# Trello Taskboards

This app provides you with a full view for an entire team on Trello, clearly showing which users are in the team and which cards are assigned to those users. You can also add multiple teams and switch between them in-app.

This is particularly useful if you are involved in a large team and want to see everyone's workload at a glance. Trello current only allows you to view the cards assigned to one user at a time.

Customise users and teams by changing the files in _src/js/data_
